********** Streaming Deployment - Debug Container **********
In a streaming architectural deployment, this container is designed for debugging and basic tasks. This container does not provide adequate resources for performant activities such as large ingestions with G2Loader; it is deployed with minimal CPU and memory resources and is not autoscaling. Instead the appropriate mechanism for ingestion should be utilized, e.g., queues and Senzing stream-loader.
